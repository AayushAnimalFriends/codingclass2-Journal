We worked on organising things and actually naming things based on what they are. We learned about files and folders and how these can help us classifiying things. We also learned about github desktop and that it saves our changes and the history lets you see your changes to organize them by time and when you made them from oldest at the bottom and newest at top. So basically main point is organising.
